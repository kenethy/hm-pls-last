# Favicon Generation Instructions

To properly generate the favicon files for your website, follow these steps:

1. Use the `logoputih.png` file in this directory as the source image.

2. Visit a favicon generator website like [RealFaviconGenerator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/) or [Favicon.io](https://favicon.io/).

3. Upload the `logoputih.png` file to the generator.

4. Configure the settings as needed (you can use the default settings).

5. Download the generated favicon package.

6. Replace the placeholder files in this directory with the generated files:
   - favicon.ico
   - apple-touch-icon.png
   - favicon-32x32.png
   - favicon-16x16.png
   - android-chrome-192x192.png
   - android-chrome-512x512.png
   - safari-pinned-tab.svg

7. The website is already configured to use these files, so once you replace them, your favicon will appear in search results and browser tabs.

## Important Notes

- Make sure to keep the same filenames as listed above.
- The favicon files should be placed directly in the `public/favicon/` directory.
- The main `favicon.ico` file should also be copied to the `public/` directory root.
- The site.webmanifest and browserconfig.xml files have already been configured correctly.

After completing these steps, your website will display the Hartono Motor logo as the favicon in search engine results and browser tabs.
